# Learning Go

*Currently following [Quii's Learning Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)*

## TODOs

- [ ] Read more about [Parametric Polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism).
- [ ] Explore [automatic dereferencing](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Method_values) of `struct` pointers in Go.
- [ ] What is "sympathetic code"?
- [ ] ["Donâ€™t just check errors, handle them gracefully"](https://dave.cheney.net/2016/04/27/dont-just-check-errors-handle-them-gracefully).
- [ ] Why are maps not considered "reference types", when they don't require passing address for modification? ([Read article](https://dave.cheney.net/2017/04/30/if-a-map-isnt-a-reference-variable-what-is-it))
- [ ] Why should I create constant errors? ([Read article](https://dave.cheney.net/2016/04/07/constant-errors))
