# Learning Go

*Currently following [Quii's Learning Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)*

## TODOs

- [ ] Read more about [Parametric Polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism).
- [ ] Explore [automatic dereferencing](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Method_values) of `struct` pointers in Go.
- [ ] What is "sympathetic code"?
- [ ] ["Donâ€™t just check errors, handle them gracefully"](https://dave.cheney.net/2016/04/27/dont-just-check-errors-handle-them-gracefully).
